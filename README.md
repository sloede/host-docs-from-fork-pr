# host-docs-from-fork-pr

This repo was created as a quick'n'dirty way to host manually generated
documentation, e.g., for Trixi.jl, where we cannot use the automatic build
process. This happens mainly when a PR is created from a fork, for which no
documentation preview can be auto-generated.

**Note: This repository and its contents may change at any time and without
warning, including its deletion.**
